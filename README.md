# laser_cutter_focusing_jig
simple laser cut jig to allow quick and precise adjustment of laser cutter bed height for focusing

- use the spreadsheet to adjust parameters
- main parameters are focusing distance (bottom of cone to top of laser honeycomb bed) and acrylic thickness
- Place the focusing jig on the laser head, and jog the Z axis until the jig "falls off"
- FreeCAD file edited to suit my requirements based on a design provided by Morgan Wable of HackPGH in Pittsburgh
